Description: This is a project I created as I was learning React.js and Next.js. I used React and Tailwind CSS to make the appearance of the music player ressemble that of Spotify. I used Next Auth for the log in system and to generate access and refresh tokens for users when they log into the app. Also, I used Spotify API to fetch the user's playlists information and was able to display them on the sidebar. Moreover, I used the API to fetch song information like artist, song name,album, and duration so that I could display that in the center component. The user is able to choose songs of their liking and perform different operations on them like, play, pause, skip forward, rewind, and change the volume. 

Possible improvements:
- Add a home page to the application 
- Add a recommended genre page for the user
- Allow the user to search for songs on Spotify 

Installation:

There is no need to install because I've deployed the app to vercel.

<strong>Note: In order for this app to work, the user must have a Spotify player up and running in the background, either online or on the desktop app.</strong>
